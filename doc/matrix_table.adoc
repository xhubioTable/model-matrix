== Matrix Table
This table is used to defined changes on an existing state of an application.
For example the is a decision table for creating a payment. Then this table
may use the created payment as an input and defines rules to bring it to the next state.

The table has a source part and an actions part. The source part refers to a current state.
The action part defines which state change should be applied.

The Matrix itself defines which actions to be applied on which source state.
